Generally this compression shouldn't work very well for the smaller test cases. I'm hoping it'll work better for the longer one's though... |

According to the original calculations compressed seems to be working but expand needs work. I'll work more tonight to finish this... |

I used bit-shifting to make my getBits method more succinct and changed the number of bits to accomodate for the longest run, which saves the most amount of space compraed to using a huge number of wasted bits. I made sure to test mystery as well and I found the duck using 80 bits :) |
| December 2  |  7:30-8pm   | I rewrote this to use the 8-bit method, which made my code far more succinct. I like this strategy and the simpleness of this strategy compared to my original. I'm still really fond of my "value = 1 - value" line, and changing the count to 1 after each change made sure my compression was not lossy, but lossless. I also added the extra one at the end because the final run should also be written in to ensure the proper expanded file. |
