Generally this compression shouldn't work very well for the smaller test cases. I'm hoping it'll work better for the longer one's though... |

According to the original calculations compressed seems to be working but expand needs work. I'll work more tonight to finish this... |
| November 19 | 8:45-9:45pm | I changed a lot here. I especially worked on fixing the logic in my compress and expand methods. I used bit-shifting to make my getBits method more succinct and changed the number of bits to accomodate for the longest run, which saves the most amount of space compraed to using a huge number of wasted bits. I made sure to test mystery as well and I found the duck using 80 bits :) |
