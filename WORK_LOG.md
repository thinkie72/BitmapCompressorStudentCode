| November 15 | 10:30-11pm  | Caden and I worked together to figure out that we could probably store the value of the first digit and then just continue to write out the number of that number in the file. Generally this compression shouldn't work very well for the smaller test cases. I'm hoping it'll work better for the longer one's though... |

According to the original calculations compressed seems to be working but expand needs work. I'll work more tonight to finish this... |
