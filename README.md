# BitmapCompressor
#### A puzzle created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA

## Your goal
Complete the functions, `compress()` and `expand()`.

`compress()` reads in binary data from a bitmap passed through `StdIn`. It compresses it, then outputs binary data to `StdOut`.

`expand()` reads in binary data from `StdIn`, expands it, and outputs binary data for a bitmap to `StdOut`.

The function headers are in the `BitmapCompressor` java file. Write your code there.

You can compile and run your code at the command-line. Tester files have been provided for you (in the src folder).
